    <title>Finding Numbers With Even Number of Digits</title>

</head>
<body>
    <h1>Problem: Find the number of numbers that have even digits in an array</h1>
    <h2>Solution: Algorithm Used</h2>
    <p>
        <ol> I initialized count = 0, to store the count of number with even digits. </ol> 
        <ol> I looped through each number in the array: I used .toString() to convert the numbers into a string.
            I used .length to get the length of the string which is the number of digits in a number.
            I used digitCount to store the number of digits in a number and checked if it is even.
            For even digits counted, count is incremented. 
        </ol>
    <ol> I returned count to output the number of even digit numbers in the array. </ol> 
    </p>
    <script>
        class Solution {
    findNumbers(nums) {
        let count = 0;

        for (let num of nums) {
            let digitCount = num.toString().length;
            if (digitCount % 2 === 0) { 
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count; 
    }
}

const solution = new Solution();
const numbers = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896, 345682];
console.log(solution.findNumbers(numbers));
